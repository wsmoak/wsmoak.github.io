Interesting things from Week 45 - November 6, 2023 to November 12, 2023

(1) [Ruby on Rails: The Documentary](https://youtu.be/HDKUEXBF3B4?si=DJO4FuNIfsnwXg1Z)

I remember this feeling of being involved with something big at the beginning.  For me it was Struts at The Apache Software Foundation back in the 2000's.
That was back when Sun Microsystems and Java were still popular.  I was having such fun that I ignored this "Ruby" thing that people were talking about.
And then Sun imploded and _waves in the general direction of Oracle and lawsuits and..._ everything changed.

(2) [Founders Podcast #326 on Anna Wintour](https://www.founderspodcast.com/episodes/58741411/senra-326-anna-wintour) | 
    [David Senra's notes](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidsenra_my-notes-from-anna-wintours-biography-turned-activity-7128866891137212417-mbMu)

If you watched "The Devil Wears Prada" movie, the Meryl Streep character is based on Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour.

(3) [Art of Investing Podcast #4 with David Senra](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/art-of-investing/david-senra-lessons-from-the-UrIFyLpR6uA/)

[Art of Investing is a course at Notre Dame](https://ndigi.nd.edu/programs/courses/) and the teachers have started a podcast.  
They brought David Senra of the Founders podcast in for an interview and he explains why and how he does what he does.

(4) [Ruby Extensions in VS Code](https://wsmoak.net/2023/10/11/ruby-extensions-in-vs-code.html)

My first blog post in a while!  Solving an annoyance I ran into when F12 stopped working in VS Code.
