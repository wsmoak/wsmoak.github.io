# Introduction

This is an example document in Tufte Handout Format.  It is edited in RStudio in RMarkdown format and transformed into a PDF with File -> Knit from the menu, or Cmd-Shift-K.

# Tufte Handout

> Tufte Handouts[^tufte-handout] are documents formatted[^tufte-latex] in the style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufteâ€™s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography:

The format has the usual `#` and `##` headings. Also margin figures (see the equation --> over there, with a caption even,) as well as full-width and main-column figures. 

\begin{marginfigure}
$$ x^2 + y^2 = 1 $$
\caption{An equation}
\end{marginfigure}


# Elixir Code

Here is some Elixir code *and the output*, which was produced by executing the code at the time the PDF was created:

\marginnote{This is a margin note.}

```{elixir}
defmodule Math do
  def sum(a, b) do
    a + b
  end
end

IO.puts "The answer is #{ Math.sum(4,3) }"    
```

In the source[^source] of this document, you will find the code that makes this possible, adapted from an article on running Go snippets in RMarkdown files[^go-rmd].
